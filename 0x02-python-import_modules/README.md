# Python - Import and Modules üõí
### Description
In this project directory we shall be looking at:
1. Importing functions from other files
2. Using imported functions
3. Creating a module
4. Using built-in Functions ```dir()```
5. Preventing code from being executed when imported
6. How to use command line arguments in Python Programs

#### Task 1 üìù
A program that imports the function ```def add(a, b)```  from the file  ```add_0.py``` :and prints the result of the addition ```1 + 2 = 3```
#### Task 2 
A program that imports functions from the file  ```calculator_1.py```, does some Maths, and prints the result.
#### Task 3 üßÆ
A program that prints the results of the addition of all arguments
#### Task 4
Program that prints the number of and the lists of it arguments
#### Task 5
Program that imports a variable ```a``` from the file ```variable_load_5.py``` and prints its value.
#### Task 6 üìä
A program that imports all functions from the file ```calculator_1.py``` and handles basic operations.
Usage:```./100-my_calculator.py a operator b```
If the number of arguments is not 3, your program has to:
print ```Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py <a> <operator> <b>``` followed with a new line
exit with the value ```1```
```operator``` can be:
```+``` for addition
```-``` for subtraction
```*``` for multiplication
```/``` for division
If the operator is not one of the above:
print ```Unknown operator. Available operators: +, -, * and /``` followed with a new line
exit with the value ```1```
#### Task 7
 A program that prints ```#pythoniscool```, followed by a new line, in the standard output.
No use of ```print``` or ```eval``` or ```open``` or  ```import sys``` in your file  ```101-easy_print.py```
