# Python -if/else, loops, functions ðŸŽƒ
### Description 
The folder consists of projects that are aimed at proper understanding of ```if```, ```for loops``` and building ```functions```
### Projects
1. Positive Number
#### Description
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
[Source code](https://github.com/Peter5793/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py)
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
a. if the number is greater than 0: is positive
b. if the number is 0: is zero
c. if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line
#### 2. Combination of Numbers
 A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
The two digits must be different
01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
Print only the smallest combination of two digits
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
The last number should be followed by a new line

#### 3. Function for Lowercase
Function that checks for lowercase
```def islower(c)```
#### 4. Function for uppercase
Function that prints string in uppercase
```def isupper(str)```
#### 5. Print last digit of a number
```def print_last_digit(number)```
#### 6. Addition
Function that adds two integers
```def add(a,b)```
#### 7.Power function
Function that computes ```a``` to the power of ```b```
```def pow(a,b)```
#### 8. Fizz Buzz
A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
Prototype: ```def fizzbuzz()```
#### 9. Insert in sorted list
A  function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
1. Prototype ```listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number)```
2. Return: the address of the new node, or ```NULL``` if it failed
#### 10. Smile in the mirror ðŸ“œ
ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
